#Filament Card Generator

So I took the Filament Sample Card from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2997350 and wrote a script to generate .scad files based on entries in a CSV.

I also wrote a crappy bash script to process them on the CLI with OpenSCAD to drop STLs, but that's still a work in progress.
